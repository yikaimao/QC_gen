Most of the work is based on the (now deprecated) [Qiskit Textbook](https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook).

The implementation of generalized Shor's Algorithm is based on [ShorAlgQiskit](https://github.com/ttlion/ShorAlgQiskit) by Rui Maia and Tiago Le√£o.

This project is also inspired by code from [Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit), [Qiskit Algorithms](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-algorithms), and [Qiskit Machine Learning](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning).
